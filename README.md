# Skatescribe


## Task Details

Create an app based on the design in the image below. You do not have to create a working chat app, we are just testing your ability to create a UI from a design. 

Share your finished product with us on GitHub, and set up a live demo and share the URL with us. 

Create the styling using only vanilla CSS, do not use Bootstrap, Material UI, or similar frameworks. 

You can use the library faker.js to generate mock data for names, messages, etc. (https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)
